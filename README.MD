Analysing YouTube channel consistency

## Introduction

This is a simple dashboard app, which analyses how consistent a YouTube channel is posting videos.

The inspiration for this project came from Ali Abdaal. Ali Abdaal preaches about consistency. So, the question is how consistent is Ali Abdaal at posting YouTube video. Also, we will look at some other interesting channel statistics.

## How to use

All you need is the channel ID or you can enter the YouTube video URL of the interested channel. A animated gif will demonstrate this below.

## How to get his to work for you

If you would like to run this locally, you can simply clone the repository.

You will then need to get up an API token with the YouTube Data API. [Here is a good resource on how to do this plus more](https://shivansivakumaran.com/coding/my-tubestats-app/).
