Analysing YouTube channel consistency

## Introduction

This is a simple dashboard app, which analyses how consistent a YouTube channel is posting videos.

The inspiration for this project came from Ali Abdaal. Ali Abdaal preaches about consistency. So, the question is how consistent is Ali Abdaal at posting YouTube video. Also, we will look at some other interesting channel statistics.
