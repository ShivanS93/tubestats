## Introduction

This is a simple dashboard app, which analyses a YouTube channel, providing interesting statistics.

The inspiration for this project came from Ali Abdaal. Ali Abdaal preaches about consistency. So, the question is how consistent is Ali Abdaal at posting YouTube video. Also, we will look at some other interesting channel statistics.
